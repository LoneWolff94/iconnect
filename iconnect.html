            <p data-aos="fade-up">MDS is a rare blood cells in the bone marrow do not grow to become healthy red blood cells,white blood cells,or platelets-all the vital components of blood.Not being able to develop healthy red blood cells leads to anemia, which is common
                with MDS. Anemia has many of the same symptoms as MDS and causes even greater fatigue.</p>
            <p data-aos="fade-up">It can be ezhausting to live with a condition that makes you feel like you're being held back. If you're caring for a loved one with the condition,it can be equally trying. However, right now, research is undereway on an investigational study
                drug to see if it may help alleviate anemic symptoms and better manage your MDS, And you may be able to take part in this study.</p>
